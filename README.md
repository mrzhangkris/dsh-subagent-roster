## One prompt. A working team.

`dsh-agent-teams` turns the current DeepSeek Harness session into a captain that can assemble durable sub-agents, split a goal into dependency-aware tasks, and coordinate work through direct messages.

Ask in natural language. The plugin provides the team protocol, 13 coordination tools, persistent state, an automatic shared-task scheduler, and a live Web UI—without requiring a separate workflow engine.

## Releases

[v0.1.17](./release-notes/v0.1.17.md) adds automatic light, dark, and system theme support on the npm `latest` channel. Activity panels, conversation cards, and dialog controls follow Harness semantic colors. Recommended host: DeepSeek Harness `0.1.5-rc.1`; the three older supported host targets are retained.

## Why AgentTeams?

| Capability | What it changes |
| --- | --- |
| **Captain-led delegation** | The current session creates the team, assigns roles, and consolidates the final result. |
| **Durable members** | Members are continuable DSH sub-agents that can be woken for focused follow-up turns. |
| **Dependency-aware tasks** | Tasks move through explicit states and cannot be claimed before their dependencies finish. |
| **Automatic reuse and safe takeover** | Idle members claim the next ready task; reassignment revokes stale attempts before new work starts, and cold recovery retries stranded open attempts. |
| **Direct messaging** | Members send durable mailbox messages directly to teammates or the captain—no relay required. |
| **Live activity panel** | The Web UI combines segmented progress, a collapsible roster, and an interactive task DAG; running tasks show the member's model, and completed archives retain their full member and task history. |
| **Plan before execution** | Normal `/agent-teams` runs stage an unspawned roster and DAG first. The Web panel uses the host model catalog for member routes. Returning to chat stops the planning turn, asks what should change, and revises the same draft; discarding archives the draft, aborts the turn, and explicitly prevents automatic recreation. Only **Approve & Run** creates members and starts scheduling. |
| **Quality gates** | Opt-in quality tasks support requirements → implementation → verification → review → integration contracts, automatic repair/re-review, and explicit resume. Scope control is a completion-time audit, not host write interception. See [docs/quality-gates.md](./docs/quality-gates.md). |

The conversation card and activity panel use Harness's official locale service. They follow live language changes between English and Simplified Chinese—including status labels, dynamic summaries, controls, archive markers, and accessibility text—without a page reload or a separate plugin setting.

## Install and choose versions

**Recommended pair: DeepSeek Harness `0.1.5-rc.1` + AgentTeams `0.1.17`. Harness remains a prerelease.**

| Use case | DeepSeek Harness | AgentTeams plugin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Recommended installation** | **`0.1.5-rc.1`** | **`0.1.17`** |
| Retaining an older RC | `0.1.2-rc.1` | `0.1.17` |
| Developer Alpha testing | `0.1.2-alpha.5` | `0.1.17` |
| Retaining an older Alpha | `0.1.2-alpha.2` | `0.1.17` |

### 1. Install DeepSeek Harness

```sh
npm install --global @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.5-rc.1
dsh --version
```

Skip this if you already run this version. Alpha is opt-in: select an exact Alpha version from the table and lock all host dependencies as described in the [maintenance guide](./docs/maintenance-workflow.md).

### 2. Install the AgentTeams plugin

Install into the `web` profile. Replace the profile name if needed:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add --save-exact @nanmicoder/dsh-agent-teams@0.1.17
```

**After installation, stop and restart Harness for that profile, then refresh the browser.**

The default npm `latest` tag points to `0.1.17`, so `dsh plugin --profile web add @nanmicoder/dsh-agent-teams` installs this version on a fresh profile. Use the exact-version command above to pin it. The recommended Harness version is `0.1.5-rc.1`; installing the plugin does not upgrade the host. See the [source installation guide](./docs/maintenance-workflow.md) and [release verification](./docs/releases/v0.1.17/README.md).

> Desktop users must check the app's embedded Harness core; upgrading the global CLI does not upgrade it. For older `0.1.0-*` / `0.1.1-*` or unlisted hosts, keep a working pair and follow the [older-version and diagnostic guide](./docs/maintenance-workflow.md).

See the full [compatibility matrix](./compatibility.json), [source installation and Alpha testing guide](./docs/maintenance-workflow.md), and [verification coverage and platform limits](./docs/maintenance-2026-09-06/release/README.md).

Then ask for a team directly:

> Use AgentTeams to review the commits after v0.5.3 from performance, security, and product perspectives. Return one consolidated report.

## How it works

1. For a request to use AgentTeams, the captain follows the core protocol already in its system instructions. It continues an existing team and uses `agent_teams_status` when current state needs checking. When no team exists, the goal becomes a staged plan for review.
2. The captain adds role-specific members backed by continuable sub-agents.
3. The goal becomes tasks with owners and explicit dependencies.
4. The shared scheduler uses real `running / idle / ready` state to atomically claim one ready task per idle member and wake it. An interrupted resident attempt stays parked and can resume through a direct message without losing its capability; after a cold process restart, the scheduler retries stranded open work with a fresh attempt.
5. Members update with the current `attempt_id`; reassignment or captain takeover revokes the old attempt and waits for the old worker to quiesce before a new attempt starts.
6. The captain presents the combined result, then archives the complete team record.

Team state is stored under `<workspace>/.agent-teams/`; the Web panel reads that disk truth and combines it with live sub-agent activity.

Member creation is zero-interaction by default: a member on the captain's current LLM route snapshots that provider, model, and reasoning effort, while a member on a requested alternative route snapshots the target model's default effort; later continuations restore the resolved snapshot. Only an explicit heterogeneous-team request (for example, “backend on provider A/model X, frontend on provider B/model Y”) supplies a member-specific `provider` + `model`; there is no per-member model or reasoning prompt.

Captain sessions keep the concise core protocol and the original 13 native team tools from their first request. All business tools are directly available; no loading tool or extra activation call is needed. Configured profiles retain their bounded directory in the fixed system prompt. Creating, approving, continuing or ending a team does not rewrite the system prompt or tool schemas. Core rules remain available after history compaction or discarded code-mode tool results. Members receive four team tools, fixed member instructions, and their ordinary coding/research tools. Web approval wakes the captain with a control message; later member reports wake it again. See the [fixed protocol and benchmark contract](./docs/progressive-loading.md).

## Slash command

No “use AgentTeams” phrasing required. The plugin registers the
closed-namespace `/agent-teams` host command, so the Web GUI slash menu shows
an `agent-teams` placeholder with an input hint: pick it (or type the
command), describe the goal, and press Enter.

```
/agent-teams research the pricing pages of three competitors
```

The command pipeline claims the line, then preserves that exact input as an
ordinary user follow-up so it remains visible in the main chat. The gesture
boundary adds the deterministic activation directive at pre-step, so the
first model request follows the staged planning protocol without a mandatory helper call. The invocation is also durably
logged (`command/run` / `command/done`).

Surfaces without command adjudication (for example the headless CLI) get the
same deterministic activation through a gesture boundary: any genuine user
message starting with `/agent-teams` activates the protocol for the rest of
the text. Mid-sentence mentions stay ordinary prose.

Historical panels require saved team state or archives. Sessions from early versions that deleted teams without retaining archives do not yet support reconstructing the full panel from logs.

## Configuration

Defaults work without extra setup. A trusted profile can override member behavior:

```yaml
- id: agent-teams
  config:
    stateDir: .agent-teams
    memberProvider: spawn
    memberModel: deepseek-v4
    memberMaxDepth: 1
    maxMembers: 8
```

`memberProvider` is the sub-agent runtime backend (`spawn` / `fork`), not an LLM provider. Cross-LLM-provider routing uses the optional `provider` + `model` fields of `agent_teams_add_member`; `memberModel` is only a model default for all members. A member on the captain's current provider/model inherits the captain's reasoning effort, while a changed provider or model automatically uses the target model's default. To request a particular effort, pass the optional `reasoning_effort` field — one of the target model's supported effort ids, or `"default"` to force the model's own default.

`slashCommand: false` disables the deterministic `/agent-teams` activation surfaces (slash command and gesture boundary), leaving the natural-language trigger as the only entry point.

## Boundaries

- One captain leads one active team at a time.
- Idle members with no open task are automatically reused for ready work. An idle member that still owns an open attempt is parked until messaged or explicitly reassigned; messages that cannot be delivered live remain durable and are retried at a later status boundary.
- State is file-backed and serialized within one DSH process; concurrent processes editing the same team are not coordinated.
- The activity panel reports persisted state as-is. Models may occasionally finish work without performing the expected task-state update.

## Named multi-role profiles

Configure one or more complete team profiles in `cordis.patch.yml`. A profile always supplies the roster (independent provider/model/role/reasoning effort). Set `taskPlanning: captain` when the Captain should derive the DAG from the user's goal; omit it or set `taskPlanning: seed` to keep a fixed template workflow:

```yaml
profiles:
  demo-delivery:
    description: Ship a small feature
    protocol: Discuss requirements, review, test, then prepare release; do not deploy automatically.
    members:
      - name: analyst
        model: gpt-5.6-sol
        role: Analyze requirements
      - name: implementer
        model: gpt-5.6-terra
        role: Implement the approved solution
    tasks:
      - id: requirements
        subject: Requirements discussion
        assignee: analyst
      - id: implementation
        subject: Implement solution
        assignee: implementer
        dependencies: [requirements]
```

Use an explicit profile flag: `/agent-teams --profile demo-delivery implement the feature`. The first ordinary token is never treated as an implicit profile. Normal command runs call `agent_teams_create({ profile, approval: "required" })`: the roster and seed/Captain-designed DAG remain staged, no child session is created, and no task is claimed. Edit the plan in the activity panel using the host model catalog, return to chat so the Captain asks what to revise and then atomically updates the same draft, discard it, or click **Approve & Run**. Return/discard actions cancel any planning turn still running; discard also parks model-facing context that forbids silently creating a replacement team. Approval resolves the final provider/model/reasoning choices, atomically spawns the roster, and starts only ready tasks. A running team is stopped from its own panel header through a confirmation dialog rather than from the composer. Direct tool clients may pass `approval: "automatic"` for the legacy immediate path. Failed review/test tasks do not unlock downstream work; automatic repair/review tasks do not depend on the failed review.

## Named subagent roster (settings card)

Beyond the team workflow, the plugin maintains a **named subagent roster**: durable, user-authored roles that a captain session dispatches through the `roster_agent` tool (`roster_list` shows the enabled directory; the dynamic system-prompt section lists the same roles every request). Maintain the roster in **Settings → Plugins → 子智能体花名册** — changes commit live to the `subagent-roster` settings namespace and are visible to the next dispatch without a restart.

Field meanings:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Unique key; `roster_agent` addresses the role by this name. Renaming an existing role asks for confirmation — later dispatches must use the new name. |
| `icon` | Single emoji shown next to the role wherever it renders (section, tool directory, settings card). Optional. |
| `description` | One-line summary (≤ 100 chars) the captain reads when deciding whom to dispatch. |
| `persona` | The role's system prompt (≤ 20000 chars), injected into every member spawned for the role. |
| `modelPolicy` | `inherit` (the captain's route, default), `fixed` (explicit provider + model), or `auto` (try the roster-level auto chain in order). |
| `reasoningEffort` | Free-text passthrough to the model adapter — verbatim, unvalidated; empty uses the provider default. |
| `maxTokens` / `maxDepth` | Optional response token cap; delegation depth cap (default `3`). |
| `toolFilter` | Tool gate for members of the role — `deny` or `allow` list, never both. Names are NOT validated against the live tool surface (they are matched at dispatch time); **roles intended to be dispatched by members (second-level delegation) should configure a toolFilter to narrow the tool surface**. |
| `backgroundMode` | `continuable` (durable member, default) or `one-shot` (foreground by default, background with `run_in_background`). |
| `enabled` | Disabled roles stay in the list but are skipped by dispatch and the prompt section. |

The **auto chain** is roster-level: for `auto`-policy roles the plugin resolves candidates in order (order is priority) and the first resolvable route wins; when every candidate fails, the role's `fallback` decides — `error` (default) refuses the dispatch, `inherit` falls back to the captain's model with a visible warning note on the result.

Import/export: **Export** downloads the current roster as `subagent-roster.json`; **Import** validates the WHOLE document first and replaces atomically (all-or-nothing) — a file with any invalid role is rejected with per-field located errors, and a file written by a newer schema (`schemaVersion > 1`) refuses with a read-only upgrade message. Saves are revision-fenced: if another window changed the roster while you edited, the write is refused with 「名单已被其他窗口修改，请刷新后重做（本次改动将丢弃）」 instead of silently overwriting.
