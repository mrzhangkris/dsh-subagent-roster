/**
 * Durable subagent-roster state types.
 *
 * A team is one directory under the state root holding `team.json` plus an
 * `inbox/` of per-agent JSONL mailboxes. Members are continuable subagents
 * whose durable child session ids are recorded in the team file, so a team
 * survives harness restarts.
 *
 * Narrowed from the agent-teams fork: tasks are plain status records
 * (`pending` → `in_progress` → `completed`/`failed`/`cancelled`) without a
 * dependency graph, claim/revoke capabilities, or quality-gate contracts.
 * The `claimed` status and `attempt`/`attemptId` fields remain valid so
 * durable records written by the upstream fork still load.
 * @module dsh-subagent-roster/types
